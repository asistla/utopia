The problem of consciousness has been open for atleast a few thousand years. 
Recent years have seen some truly astounding breakthroughs in understanding the brain and its function, 
as well as great steps in our understanding of how its physical function gives rise to particular 
subjective experiences. However, the ultimate barrier remains unscathed- the line between what the brain 
does, and what happens to us.

This is frustrating, and a little humiliating, but also, and crucially, dangerous; our inability to understand
and explain such a basic and ubiquitous part of the experience of being human, arguably our paramount purpose
as a species, has seen entire cultures rise around particular interpretations of it.

Simultaneously, the recent media frenzy around large language models, and the subsequent debates about 
the likelihood of LLMs, or AI in generally, suddenly become conscious, as sentient requires 
consciousness, have shown that we are also quite willing, in general, to substantially diminish the 
definition of consciousness itself in order to make AI fit the definition. Of course, this is as 
worthless as those that simply reject the premise as altogether impossible; after all, the definition of 
consciousness, as with any other word in any other language, is simply a matter of consensus. 
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what it actually is, or what it feels like, or how it behaves, as 
it changes from person to person, or maybe just their perception of it, but perception itself ultimately 
relies on consciousness to make the information 'known' as opposed to just being available.. if there is a productive approach here, I cannot find it.

Finally, there is the simple matter of defining the problem well. The hard problem of consciousness, in 
my view, is hard precisely because of how ambitiously its jurisdiction is assumed, and how overbroad the 
problem is made to be. Suppose I wanted to explain flames. I know the physical basis of a flame; the 
volatiles and combustible particulates burn in atmospheric oxygen creating a stream of gas that is hot 
enough to glow in the visible range. However, my subjective experience of direct physical interactions 
involving contact, is invariably of painful burns. In fact, it doesn't matter what is burnt and what the 
flame looks like, or whether it even is visible - if I touch it, it will burn me. 
However, the fact that all our direct physical interactions with a flame result in painful burns, does not make

We can see the rough 
contours of an analogy forming here. We understand the physics and chemistry of a flame, and then there 
is a gap, and then there is the subjective experience of it. This gap is not entirely empty; we know 
there are physical processes that are fairly well understood. At the area near the burn, nociceptors 
start firing off chemical signals to the message neurons, which then pass them over time to the brain or spine.
At this point, 'something' happens that involves our consciousness, our subjective sense of self, language,
memory, and a whole lot else, which leads to a painful burn and an "oh FUCK".

While there have been many promising approaches, as a whole, any real insight evades us. In fact, our problems
are significantly more severe; we have not yet been able to agree on a definition for consciousness, nor do we
have a reliable and universally applicable test for consciousness. The recent media frenzy about language models
'developing consciousness' has served as a grim reminder of the fact that for the vast majority of people, there
is little difference between true consciousness, and a convincing pretense of it.

In my personal and extremely unqualified view, this is unbecoming of a species that sent a space probe 
currently in 'deep space' fifty years ago, and there is a certain humiliating irony in the fact that 
while we have directly observed black holes, gravitational waves, and the mind-bending physics of the 
quantum scale, and yet our ability to completely describe our own internal experience, even our own 
perception of ourselves, remains far beyond reach, with current treatments and analyses relying on higher 
level abstractions and the overall functional behavior even if we do not know why these behaviors arise.


In an attempt to help drag us out of this rut, I propose a wholly unqualified opinion, and an exploration 
of the consequences and implications of this treatment of consciousness. This is not meant to be a theory 
of consciousness, or even a formal claim of having explained one of more aspects of it. This is meant to 
be the planks laid in the tyre-tracks so we can drive our way towards an explanation, merely an 
alternative avenue that I claim is sufficiently consistent to warrant analysis by more competent minds.

1. What are we dealing with?

We are trying to come up with a view of consciousness that is internally consistent, consistent with all 
 our observations and experiences, and hopefully makes predictions that can be tested. Now, in its 
 simplest and most accurate definition, sight is the perception of light in our surroundings. We know how 
 this works; lenses focus ambient light onto the retina, which then sends electrical impulses into the 
 brain. The specifics of this process are irrelevant; all we are concerned with is the fact that we can 
 trace a purely physical process of perception until it reaches the brain, at which point, by 'some 
 magic', this perception becomes available as internalized information, even if transient. Crucially, note 
that the conscious perception of our surroundings, visual or otherwise, is not actually a perception of our 
surroundings, but instead the culmination of a rather elaborate and complex calculation involving the 
brain's past experiences, memories of the sensory cues surrounding those experiences, the results of any 
interactions with these surroundings, which is then used to create a nearly unfailingly accurate 'guess' 
of the most likely cause of the particular set of sensory inputs. 

In particular, note that the moment the light hits the retina, or sound hits the eardrum, or any other 
stimulus turns into an electrical impulse, we are for all intents and purposes, detached from reality; we 
must navigate our universe relying exclusively on the stories our brain makes up. In fact, this reality 
is not even 'directly' available to the brain, which must make do with the electrical impulses which are 
not nearly 'consistent' enough to serve as a reliable signal. (Exactly identical images do not result in 
exactly identical retinal impulses). Further, also note that it is not sufficient for the sensory organs 
to simply deliver these impulses to the brain, or even the brain receiving these impulses correctly.
Put simply, 'I' do not perceive reality, I only perceive the picture my brain creates. We can see a promising
lead forming here: perception requires sensory organs, so like external light requires eyes, and the brain requires neural impulses, the picture of reality the brain has created must also require a sensory organ.

This, I claim, is all consciousness. Effectively a 'software' sensory organ, the exclusive purpose of consciousness
is to perceive the internal state of the brain through 'some' abstractions.

We can track this extreme separation of function to the immediate next 'level'; the picture of reality 
that the brain makes up are entirely independent of consciousness itself, which we have defined as the 
awareness of our internal state. If we look at this from the other side, we know the brain has invented 
some picture of our reality based on the cues it has received from our sensory organs. There must be a way
for our conscious self to actually have perceived this picture.
This, is consciousness. Consciousness is effectively a 'software' sensory organ that connects what the brain
does to what is 'known' as information; the conscious perception of a self is merely the 'knower' invented
to facilitate this process. This might sound convoluted, but to start with, we can definitely say the brain is
'capable' of inventing this subjective self, so raw processing-power is no concern. Further, we know that not
only is the brain capable of elaborate constructions, it is in fact capable of elaborate abstract constructions
outside of reality; imagination presents with a 'mind's' eye for most people, suggesting the brain can also
merely pretend like the neural impulses requiered for its construction of the moment, and involve the 
'perception' of a picture of a reality that does not exist. This 
there is no short-circuit between the senses and our conscious perception of them, but 
 instead an elaboraThis is a known phenomenon; the perception of the world around us is not necessarily 
 an accurate depiction of what is, but instead the brain's claim of what it believes to be the most 
 likely cause of the electrical impulses it has received from the sensory organs. Consider the following:

Sight is the perception of the light in our surroundings. 

One simplification 
 we can immediately make confidently, is to separate out consciousness from the constellation of 
 capabilities, behaviors and qualities that are entirely unrelated to the phenomenon of 'awareness of an 
 internal experience' itself. For example, instrospection is not a property of consciousness, but instead 
 the but instead, our intelligence, analytical, linguistic, and imaginative capabilities applied in tandem to 
 our own selves, using consciousness, the 'awareness of our internal state' as an instrument to measure 
 our internal condition.
 capabilities applied to this internal state.


athe awareness of our internal state, with intelligence, analytical capabilities and language applied to this internal state. 
 We do 
not want to attach more properties to our view of consciousness unless we need to, because the larger the 
circle around what we consider consciousness, the harder it is to explain all its myriad aspects. So how 
simply can we define consciousness, while preserving all properties that are commonly considered part of 
it? A very good candidate is simply "awareness of our internal state". This definition is vague, and 
leaves the burden of defining what 'awareness' is, and what constitutes an 'internal state'; but with a 
strictly colloqual reading, this is an accurate, if incomplete description of what most would agree 
constitutes consciousness. 
One might be tempted to get right to defining 'awareness', and 'internal states'. This is, in my view, 
the precise step where a relatively simply problem blows up into the monstrous intractable question that 
has tortured our collective minds for millennia; this mystery has created religions and killed billions. So we shall avoid it.

Consider the following: Sight is commonly defined as the power of seeing, a tautological definition
KConsider this definition as is: "Consciousness is our awareness of our internal state".
Compare this to: "Sight is the awareness of the light in our surroundings".
