incone (noun, singular: plural incones): Short for incorrect ones, a politically correct term for people who disagree with you.
Jope (noun, singular: plural jopes): A person that believes education in one subject implies competence in everything else; historically used to refer to popular intellectuals like Jordan Peterson (the original jope). While 
the specific connotations vary based on context, it is flexible enough to permit creative usage, and used well, can be a cutting insult.
Jope-congregation: A flock of followers of a jope. A jope and their congregation together make one mind out of many, strait-jacketed together by the common belief that the Jope is absolutely flawless. A Jope's flaws are seen 
by the flock not as flaws, but as qualities that must be deliberately introduced into ones life to truly live by the jope's word. A jope's flaws are not flaws, but instead define the correct norm that all other traits must be 
measured relative to. A jope's stupidity is sublime wisdom visible only to the chosen, a jope's despair is an international tragedy, and every time a jope smiles, a blonde, blue-eyed virgin becomes pregnant.
