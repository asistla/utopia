Chapter 0: Prerequisite information.

This book is a collection of my ideas on subjects I find interesting. The primary purpose behind this pointless undertaking is the near consensus that misinformation, junk science, combined with an aggressive will to believe in ideas for the sole purpose of pissing off political opponents, has overloaded our senses and left us absolutely unable to discern truth from fiction.

I disagree. Finding truth may be difficult, but spotting nonsense is easy; the insistence otherwise is just self-consoling behavior - who wants to admit they are too stupid to spot a silly fabrication online? Surely, it must be an unbelievably sophisticated deception, funded by the bottomless treasure-chests of nation-states, subtle, nuanced, convoluted, a part of one conspiracy or the other, all for the express purpose of mind-control. Otherwise there is simply no way we could be fooled. 
Obviously, that is nonsense. Our circumstances vis-a-vis (mis)information is a logical conclusion to centuries of deliberate, methodical suspension of disbelief, persistent efforts to dodge uncomfortable or inconvenient truths, and an inexplicable insistence on 'obedience'. Every effort we have made through history to deliberately suppress obvious facts, or deliberately promulgate obvious lies, with promise of eternal bliss and threats of eternal suffering, has 'trained' us in a way - ask yourself not why flat-earthers believe there is a global conspiracy to hide the shape of the earth, not why they go past the conspiracy into making such an easily falsifiable claim, nor why they insist on its truth inspite of being shown direct evidence otherwise. The only question that really matters is, at the precise moment when they went from the spheroidal earth to a flat one, how did they convince themselves? And asking this question makes the core issue quite clear; defensive arguments in a scientific confrontation aside, the fundamental problem here is the inability to make a correct judgement of the implications of a set of easily observed facts. In other words, I claim that generally, we have forgotten how to process information. Note that I say forgotten - the ease with which a person can be convinced that a fabricated statement is truth, increases with age, as the habit of formal learning atrophies. Our education places significant focus on information, which is misguided to begin with: the focus should always have been in teaching the 'ability' to learn, the ability to process information accurately, avoiding bad arguments, and maximizing one's chances of avoiding incorrect conclusions. 
However, this is not how it is done. It is not sufficient to merely learn information, whether of theory and practice, because all information that is relevant to an education is ultimately fluid. New discoveries are made, new inventions are birthed, mistakes are corrected. It makes no sense to build a foundation on a snapshot of knowledge, unless this is supplemented with the ability to account for, accomodate, and adapt to these changes. Information without a robust framework to process information and respond to changes easily and correctly. 
To be clear, this is not an automatic, or natural development; evolution has made us capable of unbelievable achievement, but this capability must be actively developed, without which we are simply letting the hardware behave as it wants to. And what the hardware tends to want in its default factory setting is determined by simple emotional responses to stimuli: often fear, anger, disillusionment, or a sort of passive rebellion, screaming drivel for the express purpose of causing perturbation and despair.

Here is a list of things I must declare before this goes any further.

1. I haven't yet recalled a collective term for _all_ the problems we face as a species. There is a consistency
in our inability to solve problems that affect large numbers of people that has plagued us throughout our existence and is important enough to warrant an honest discussion. I shall merely refer to them as PRoblems, with a capital P and R. PRoblems includes, but is not limited to: war, disease, poverty, climate change, pedophilia, rape, bigotry, plastic, partisan politics, idiotic politicians, idiotic politics, retarded policies, idiotic groups of people, flat earthers, anti-abortioners, religion, species going extinct, the lack of decent alternatives to plastic, animal abuse, traditional Chinese medicine, people who have more than two children , the ever increasing history syllabus for schoolchildren, creationists, people who leave toilet paper on the seat, cheap voters, competitive victimhood, mental illness, menstrual cramps, social media, dying arts, dying languages, dying cultures, superstition, crop failures, the carbon footprint of "Content", et cetera. PRoblems.

2. Very little research has gone into this book. One of the underlining motivations for this monumental undertaking is the fact that growing percentage of PRoblems requires expert views from experts, with the emphatic message being that because said PRoblems are so complex, and require such care and rigor in its study and ultimate solution, that the average plebian simply cannot be allowed opinions on the subject. 
This is not entirely without reason; for every significant globally relevant problem, there are multiple groups, often including some very powerful people, who believe the problem itself is an artificial construction by Some Powerful Group to achieve various ends, usually mind control and total subjugation of the populace; clearly, no good can come of letting them speak.
However, beyond the dubious moral worth of cosmetic adjustments to social discourse, restricting expression does absolutely nothing to the offending ideas and ideologies being suppressed, nor to the people espousing them. In fact, it is more likely to have the opposite effect, either with groups digging in their heels, holding on to said ideas purely out of spite, or building their own environments (whether physical or digital) dedicated to allow free expression of only the most vile ideologies that are prohibited in polite society. What follows then and forms the 'norm' within such ideological enclosures, is participants discovering, and then learning to enjoy, a sort of 'unshackling' of their minds long kept weighed down and in chains by a society that is simply too stupid to recognize the wisdom held in their ideology, and as they take their first baby steps into finally letting the imp say what it always wanted to, feel the sublime, corrosive joy jumping off the cliffs of Dover might feel like
I ask you: what is this supposed to achieve, exactly? What needs to be solved here, clearly, is not the expression or promulgation of these ideas, but the fact that so many people find these ideas attractive in the first place. There is an underlying trait that is common to racists, bigots, conspiracy theorists and religious people - perhaps common to all of us to various extents - the willingness to be convinced by ideas, to take suggestions as fact, for little reason beyond blind faith in ones own side, and unbridled contempt for the opponent.

3. In spite of a general belief that our PRoblems are extremely complex, or even require prolonged periods of academic study and consequently require similar study to have a qualified opinion at all, I believe it is absolutelypossible, and in fact easy, to atleast avoid being incorrect - if not exactly correct in the way social discourse around our Problems is undertaken. As part of this demonstration, I begin with a deliberate informational handicap - and this means no research. I will write with exactly what I already know, the qualifications I possess and the experience I have, and no more. I do not know yet how this will turn out, we will see. If there is a convincing case that the opposite is true, we will have confirmed our ultimate fate (death by being slowly cooked and seasoned with poisonous air), in which case the best approach to life would be to abandon all ideological baggage, and submerge oneself into unbridled decadence, with a sense of well-mannered anarchy. Anyway, I feel comfortable with this approach because worse books have been written. 

4. I treat these pages as something between an indifferent bartender and a confession box. Further, I will be under the influence of various hallucinogens and stimulants throughout the course of this book. This means long, winding digressions in pursuit of some silly thread of an idea, but also shifts in mood, tone, and style, depending on the chemical effects my brain is experiencing in that moment. While this goes against every style-guide in existence, one, I do not care if anyone reads this at all, and two, this is how people function in real life, our moods, thought processes and interactions being influenced by everything we put inside us, everything that surrounds us, so we are slightly different people each day. Consequently, large sections of this book will be stupid, incorrect, offensive, and generally infuriating.

5. This book is not any of the following:
    - A new hypothesis/theory about anything.
    - A claim of having solved our Problems.
    - A claim of having solutions to our Problems.
    - A claim of having access to information others do not.
    - A claim of having had insights others have not.

Do not read this book. By continuing, you are agreeing to take on the risk of emotionally distressing feelings including, but not limited to, confusion, disgust, and rage.
