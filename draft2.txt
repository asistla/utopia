Foreward.

When I first read about John B Calhoun's rat utopia experiments, my first thought was "Surely, we cannot be this
predictable?"
But every year since then, has only cemented my opinion of the experiment: as it stands, it forms a direct paral
el with our own state as a species. There are certainly valid reasons to disagree with this comparision - for on
, humans are not rats.
But to my inexperienced and ill-educated eyes, these are just nitpicks; I can understand the automatic urge to r
ject the idea that at the end of the day, we will die out exactly like rats in a perfect pen, and I can even res
ect the particular, nuanced reasons this is not a good or fair comparision.
But. There are undeniable parallels. Now, whether the story of the experiment can serve as a direct prophecy for
our own ultimate fate, is an open question, but in my view, irrelevant. What is important is that there is suffi
ient non-trivial correspondence between the Norway rats in Calhoun's enclosure, and homo sapiens in our own, and
that there is some valuable idea that can be sucked out of it. To be sure, the applicability of his experiments 
o humanity have been questioned, and his interpretations of his results have been criticized, but if it helps, you are free to consider it a pure fabrication - the ideas held within the story function just as well with a fict
onal account. Nevertheless, if you have not heard of this experiment, here is a summary.
An enclosure for Norway rats was built. They were supplied with unlimited food and water.
It was expected that given no obvious impediments to their growth, the population would keep growing into the th
usands over the course of about two years. Instead, across iterations, the experiment would invariably end with
he opposite: the mice would breed rapidly initially, but soon the population would level off, then following by
he rats breaking up into small cliques comprising of a dozen or so individuals; individual rats would develop ho
tile, anti-social and sedentary habits, and eventually, the population would die out entirely.
Among those iterations, was Universe 25. It had a nearly three square-meter enclosure, consisting of four pens w
th two hundred and fifty-six living compartments, and sixteen burrows leading to abundant food and water supplies. Each living compartment could house up to fifteen individual rats, with an overall capacity of three thousand.
A clean, comfortable enclosure with an endless supply of food and water, with no diseases or predators around, w
s as close to luxury as a rat could ever get. Into this paradise, the experiment began with four pairs of health
 mice. The first hundred or so days were spent acclimating to their new surroundings, marking territory, and nes
ing. Soon after, the rats began taking advantage of their resources, and breeding rapidly, with the population d
ubling every two months. By the end of about a year, the enclosure contained over six hundred mice. And then bea
n their decline. The number of rats at this point was about a fifth of what the enclosure could hold. And yet, m
st rats seemed to prefer crowding in specific areas, sharing the same food sources. This constant huddling soon 
ave way to a decline in mating activity, with the birth rate falling to about a third of its original level. Of 
he rats in the enclosure at this point, a third emerged as socially dominant, with the other two-thirds showing 
arked decline in social skills and status. Behavioral disparities among males of different social stature became
more marked. Those individuals at the bottom of the social order found themselves spurned by females, and eventu
lly abandoned trying to mate altogether. With no need to hunt and no mate, these rats had no function with their
society. These outcasts would soon peel off the group entirely, eating and sleeping on their own, or fighting wi
h other outcasts. The dominant males on the other hand, became more aggressive, often needlessly so, violently a
tacking other individuals with no provocation or motive, indiscriminately raping other rats - irrespective of th
ir sex. Most other males that comprised the middle of the social order, grew timid and passive, accepting violen
 attacks without protests, often dying in the process, even being cannibalized in several instances. With the ma
es having abandoned (or been deprived of) their social functions, females were left to adopt male roles during t
e rearing of pups. Consequently, some adopted more aggressive behaviour,  with their own young being the victims
of this frequently. Others shirked their own functions as well, abandoning their own litter and withdrawing from
mating activities. Infant mortality reached nearly ninety percent.
About a year and a half into the experiment, the population started to decline. Infant mortality was now about a
hundred percent. From these circumstances rose another social group, the rats that had reached maturity but had 
rown up in extremely dysfunctional circumstances, and indeed, had never been exposed to a normal society with he
lthy relationships. With no concept of, and interest in _normal_ social activities and interactions like mating
r marking territory, this group spent all their waking time eating, drinking, and grooming themselves. These _be
utiful ones_ as Calhoun called them, lived in seclusion. They avoided the anarchic social conditions by rejectin
 society itself.
With every fundamental motivation that drives life having made irrelevant, no need to establish a territory or f
nd a mate or raise young or hunt for food, these individuals found themselves in a society that had no need for 
hem. Individuals were reduced to aimless, self-absorbed entities that did nothing, for there was nothing to do.
The population eventually died out entirely.  Calhoun called this the second death _ the first was, in his view,
the beginning of the end, the complete loss of purpose in the rats_ lives. He attempted to salvage this implosio
 by placing some of the _beautiful ones_ into new enclosures that had not fallen to the anarchic conditions of t
eir own, hoping the change in circumstances might wake them from their anti-social catatonia. He failed. The rat
 simply would not change their behaviour. The eventually died out of natural causes, alone. 

Universe 25 peaked at 2200 rats. None of them survived.

The applicability of the above results as an unnervingly accurate metaphor for our own current state is obvious
indeed, the only danger here is as usual, over-interpretation of simpel facts. After all, though world today re
sembles Calhoun's rat utopia, we are not rats, and it seems we may have more agency over our own fate than rats. Whether that will make a difference at all remains to be seen. I do not believe it does; studying rats and their behaviour allows us a ertain objectivity we cannot muster when studying ourselves, and anyway, your view will depend on whether you see the rats as sentient beings with their own will and volition, or as a lower being that functions like an automa on, being driven to do things its wiring will permit it to, and nothing else, that is, whether the collapse of the rat utopia was simply the inevitable consequence of the combination of their own nature and the circumstances they were put in, or result of their own deliberate choices. But at the end of the day, even in humans, whether the specific choices made were deliberate, or a consequence of our wiring, is irrelevant; extinction works just as well without free will.
This story should serve as the background noise while you read the rest of the book.

Introduction

This book is a collection of my ideas on subjects I find interesting. The primary purpose behind this pointless undertaking is the near consensus that misinformation, junk science, combined with an aggressive will to believe in ideas for the sole purpose of pissing off political opponents, has overloaded our senses and left us absolutely unable to discern truth from fiction.

I disagree. Finding truth may be difficult, but spotting nonsense is easy; the insistence otherwise is just self-consoling behavior - who wants to admit they are too stupid to spot a silly fabrication online? Surely, it must be an unbelievably sophisticated deception, funded by the bottomless treasure-chests of nation-states, subtle, nuanced, convoluted, a part of one conspiracy or the other, all for the express purpose of mind-control. Otherwise there is simply no way we could be fooled. 
Obviously, that is nonsense. Our circumstances vis-a-vis (mis)information is a logical conclusion to centuries of deliberate, methodical suspension of disbelief, persistent efforts to dodge uncomfortable or inconvenient truths, and an inexplicable insistence on 'obedience'. Every effort we have made through history to deliberately suppress obvious facts, or deliberately promulgate obvious lies, with promise of eternal bliss and threats of eternal suffering, has 'trained' us in a way - ask yourself not why flat-earthers believe there is a global conspiracy to hide the shape of the earth, not why they go past the conspiracy into making such an easily falsifiable claim, nor why they insist on its truth inspite of being shown direct evidence otherwise. The only question that really matters is, at the precise moment when they went from the spheroidal earth to a flat one, how did they convince themselves? And asking this question makes the core issue quite clear; defensive arguments in a scientific confrontation aside, the fundamental problem here is the inability to make a correct judgement of the implications of a set of easily observed facts. In other words, I claim that generally, we have forgotten how to process information. Note that I say forgotten - the ease with which a person can be convinced that a fabricated statement is truth, increases with age, as the habit of formal learning atrophies. Our education places significant focus on information, which is misguided to begin with: the focus should always have been in teaching the 'ability' to learn, the ability to process information accurately, avoiding bad arguments, and maximizing one's chances of avoiding incorrect conclusions. 
However, this is not how it is done. It is not sufficient to merely learn information, whether of theory and practice, because all information that is relevant to an education is ultimately fluid. New discoveries are made, new inventions are birthed, mistakes are corrected. It makes no sense to build a foundation on a snapshot of knowledge, unless this is supplemented with the ability to account for, accomodate, and adapt to these changes. Information without a robust framework to process information and respond to changes easily and correctly. 
To be clear, this is not an automatic, or natural development; evolution has made us capable of unbelievable achievement, but this capability must be actively developed, without which we are simply letting the hardware behave as it wants to. And what the hardware tends to want in its default factory setting is determined by simple emotional responses to stimuli: often fear, anger, disillusionment, or a sort of passive rebellion, screaming drivel for the express purpose of causing perturbation and despair.

Here is a list of things I must declare before this goes any further.

1. I haven't yet recalled a collective term for _all_ the problems we face as a species. There is a consistency
in our inability to solve problems that affect large numbers of people that has plagued us throughout our existence and is important enough to warrant an honest discussion. I shall merely refer to them as PRoblems, with a capital P and R. PRoblems includes, but is not limited to: war, disease, poverty, climate change, pedophilia, rape, bigotry, plastic, partisan politics, idiotic politicians, idiotic politics, retarded policies, idiotic groups of people, flat earthers, anti-abortioners, religion, species going extinct, the lack of decent alternatives to plastic, animal abuse, traditional Chinese medicine, people who have more than two children , the ever increasing history syllabus for schoolchildren, creationists, people who leave toilet paper on the seat, cheap voters, competitive victimhood, mental illness, menstrual cramps, social media, dying arts, dying languages, dying cultures, superstition, crop failures, the carbon footprint of "Content", et cetera. PRoblems.

2. Very little research has gone into this book. One of the underlining motivations for this monumental undertaking is the fact that growing percentage of PRoblems requires expert views from experts, with the emphatic message being that because said PRoblems are so complex, and require such care and rigor in its study and ultimate solution, that the average plebian simply cannot be allowed opinions on the subject. 
This is not entirely without reason; for every significant globally relevant problem, there are multiple groups, often including some very powerful people, who believe the problem itself is an artificial construction by Some Powerful Group to achieve various ends, usually mind control and total subjugation of the populace; clearly, no good can come of letting them speak.
However, beyond the dubious moral worth of cosmetic adjustments to social discourse, restricting expression does absolutely nothing to the offending ideas and ideologies being suppressed, nor to the people espousing them. In fact, it is more likely to have the opposite effect, either with groups digging in their heels, holding on to said ideas purely out of spite, or building their own environments (whether physical or digital) dedicated to allow free expression of only the most vile ideologies that are prohibited in polite society. What follows then and forms the 'norm' within such ideological enclosures, is participants discovering, and then learning to enjoy, a sort of 'unshackling' of their minds long kept weighed down and in chains by a society that is simply too stupid to recognize the wisdom held in their ideology, and as they take their first baby steps into finally letting the imp say what it always wanted to, feel the sublime, corrosive joy jumping off the cliffs of Dover might feel like
I ask you: what is this supposed to achieve, exactly? What needs to be solved here, clearly, is not the expression or promulgation of these ideas, but the fact that so many people find these ideas attractive in the first place. There is an underlying trait that is common to racists, bigots, conspiracy theorists and religious people - perhaps common to all of us to various extents - the willingness to be convinced by ideas, to take suggestions as fact, for little reason beyond blind faith in ones own side, and unbridled contempt for the opponent.

3. In spite of a general belief that our PRoblems are extremely complex, or even require prolonged periods of academic study and consequently require similar study to have a qualified opinion at all, I believe it is absolutelypossible, and in fact easy, to atleast avoid being incorrect - if not exactly correct in the way social discourse around our Problems is undertaken. As part of this demonstration, I begin with a deliberate informational handicap - and this means no research. I will write with exactly what I already know, the qualifications I possess and the experience I have, and no more. I do not know yet how this will turn out, we will see. If there is a convincing case that the opposite is true, we will have confirmed our ultimate fate (death by being slowly cooked and seasoned with poisonous air), in which case the best approach to life would be to abandon all ideological baggage, and submerge oneself into unbridled decadence, with a sense of well-mannered anarchy. Anyway, I feel comfortable with this approach because worse books have been written. 

4. I treat these pages as something between an indifferent bartender and a confession box. Further, I will be under the influence of various hallucinogens and stimulants throughout the course of this book. This means long, winding digressions in pursuit of some silly thread of an idea, but also shifts in mood, tone, and style, depending on the chemical effects my brain is experiencing in that moment. While this goes against every style-guide in existence, one, I do not care if anyone reads this at all, and two, this is how people function in real life, our moods, thought processes and interactions being influenced by everything we put inside us, everything that surrounds us, so we are slightly different people each day. Consequently, large sections of this book will be stupid, incorrect, offensive, and generally infuriating.

5. This book is not any of the following:
    - A new hypothesis/theory about anything.
    - A claim of having solved our Problems.
    - A claim of having solutions to our Problems.
    - A claim of having access to information others do not.
    - A claim of having had insights others have not.

Do not read this book.

Chapter 1.

Getting started.

Here is a question. What is stopping countries from agreeing on real action against climate change? 
I invite you to resist any responsese forming in your mind, that resemble "it is an extremely complex question, with innumerable variables", and try to get to the heart of the question, which is as follows:
Given a global consensus (however misguided it may be in your view) from scientists and professionals, that the cumulative effects of industrialization and 'progress' over the past few centuries has put us on a straight and narrow path to catastrophic (and ongoing) deterioration of the environment, resources, food, water and air, especially considering the fact that cleaning up the environment is all benefits and no loss, irrespective of whether it results in 'saving humanity' or not, why are we more interested in practically every other trivial issue we can think of, than in ensuring our own long term survival?
Simultaneously, the most 'socially conscious' ones among us, the ones who have nobly accepted the thankless, backbreaking responsbility of leading humanity towards the light, a world where we can all be as we want to be, love who we want, live how we want, and preferably one where some sort of steady passive income has already been granted so they can focus their faculties on more important problems, are also some of the most active users of social media, with followers in the millions, gladly sucking in the pearls of 144-character wisdom that is periodically gifted ... what exactly is the carbon footprint of this inconsequential nonsense? How much energy do those 'inspirational quotes' cost to create, store, replicate, reproduce, and serve across the world, especially considering inspiration seems to be more reliably available when the quote is pasted onto a scenery and the whole thing turned into an image?

In short, what is the carbon footprint of "Content"?
