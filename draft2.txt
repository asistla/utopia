Chapter 0: Prerequisite information.

This book is a collection of my ideas on subjects I find interesting. This is a list of things I must declare 
before I drag you any further.

1. I haven't yet recalled a collective term for _all_ the problems we face as a species. There is a consistency
   in our inability to solve problems that affect large numbers of people that has plagued us throughout our 
   existence and is important enough to warrant an honest discussion. I shall merely refer to them as Problems, 
   with a capital P and R. PRoblems includes, but is not limited to: war, disease, poverty, climate change, 
   pedophilia, rape, bigotry, plastic, partisan politics, idiotic politicians, idiotic politics, idiotic groups 
   of people, flat earthers, anti-abortioners, religion, species going extinct, the lack of decent alternatives 
   to plastic, animal abuse, traditional Chinese medicine, people who have more than two children, the ever 
   increasing history syllabus for schoolchildren, creationists, people who leave toilet paper on the seat, 
   people voting for senseless appeasements, competitive victimhood, mental illness, menstrual cramps, 
   stupidity, et cetera. PRoblems.

2. Very little research has gone into this book. One of the underlining motivations for this monumental undertaking is the fact that growing percentage of PRoblems is relegated to experts, with the emphatic message being that because said PRoblems are so complex, and require such care and rigor in its study and ultimate solution, that the general public simply cannot be trusted to be allowed opinions on the subject. This is not entirely without reason; for every individual problem there are significant numbers of people who believe the problem itself is a conspiracy - clearly, no good can come of letting them speak.
